# react-native-wasm

## DISCLAIMER

This project is a POC not intended to be used on production apps.
It wasn't made by a C++ veteran developer (nor an intermediate one), rather made with remnants of school C++ knowledge, which means it is not optimized at all, full of bugs & memory leaks.

## WHAT

This project intends to add a WASM platform to React-Native, so that it renders an app inside a HTML Canvas.

## Thanks
